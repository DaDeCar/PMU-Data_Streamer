# Project: PMU Data Streamer

### Overview

Built a full project (back – frontend) which simulates a physical electrical equipment called “PMU”. 
This project consists of a PMU simulator written in python that generated random synchrophasors (measurements of current and voltage with a GPS tag) according to the IEEE C37.118.2 standard and streamed it to an IP address using UDP protocol. 
This work was designed to test servers that receive big data of electrical measurements. The project had a web interface for users, available to configure all the parameters. 
The project meant an improvement for the customers (server’s owner) because they no longer depended on physical equipment that generates the labeled measurements.
